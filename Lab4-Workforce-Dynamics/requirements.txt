# Lab 4: Modeling Workforce Dynamics - Requirements
# ==================================================

# Visualization
matplotlib>=3.5.0

# Numerical operations (matplotlib dependency, explicitly listed)
numpy>=1.21.0

# Note: This lab deliberately does NOT use specialized SD libraries
# (like PySD or simpy) to demonstrate the mechanics from first principles.
# The model is built using pure Python with a simple for-loop.
