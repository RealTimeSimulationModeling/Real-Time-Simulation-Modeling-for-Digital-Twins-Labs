# Lab 1: Building Your First Simulation in Python
# Requirements

# No external dependencies required!
# This lab uses only Python standard library:
# - random (for random number generation)
# - math (for logarithm function)

# Python version: 3.6 or higher

# Optional (for extension challenges only):
# matplotlib>=3.5.0  # For visualization (histogram of wait times, etc.)
# numpy>=1.21.0      # For advanced random number generation
